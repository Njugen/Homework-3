# Homework 3
By Thai Nguyen

## How to run
Due to my PC using AMD, this homework was done using Google Colabs (not CMake/Visual Studio), which has 
CUDA support.

1. Open homework3.ipynb in Google Colabs
2. In the notebook menu: Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Select T4 GPU
3. Wait for the workspace to restart
4. In the root of the notebook, upload __main.cu__, and the __data__ folder (including all
sub directories)
5. The notebook has preset commandos. Just go to Runtime -> Run all to execute all cases
